# DynamicButtonStack

DynamicButtonStack lays out a collection of buttons in either a column or a row. It dynamically adjusts the layout to suit the button content and the available space.

## Requirements

- DynamicButtonStack requires iOS 13. (On older versions `UIButton` responds to `imageEdgeInsets` slightly differently in some cases.)
- The latest stable Xcode is expected.
- Works with both Swift and Objective-C apps.

## Installation

### Recommended

1. Clone this repository.
2. Drag `DynamicButtonStack.swift` into your Xcode project and add it to your target.

### Swift Package Manager

Add DynamicButtonStack to an existing Xcode project as a package dependency:

1. From the File menu, select Swift Packages ‚Ä∫ Add Package Dependency‚Ä¶
2. Enter ‚Äúhttps://github.com/douglashill/DynamicButtonStack‚Äù as the package repository URL.

### CocoaPods

1. Add the following to your `Podfile`:
    
    ```ruby
    pod 'DynamicButtonStack'
    ```
    
2. Run the following command:
    
    ```
    pod install
    ```

The module name when using CocoaPods is `DynamicButtonStackKit`.

## Usage

Your app provides a DynamicButtonStack with buttons and a maximum width. The DynamicButtonStack then provides your app the minimum width and height required. You app then gives the DynamicButtonStack at least that amount of space and the buttons will be nicely stacked within that space.

You can supply as many buttons as you like. Their titles can be as long as you like, and the font can be as large as you like. In exchange, give the button stack the height it needs. Therefore the button stack is typically best placed in a vertically scrolling view.

Create a `DynamicButtonStack` and give it an array of buttons that each have both an image and a title. Add the button stack to your view hierarchy.

```swift
let button = UIButton()
button.setImage(UIImage(systemName: "paperplane"), for: .normal)
button.setTitle("Send", for: .normal)

buttonStack = DynamicButtonStack(buttons: [
    button,
])

view.addSubview(buttonStack)
```

The button stack can be laid out with either `sizeThatFits` and `layoutSubviews` or using constraints.

When using constraints, the stack sets its vertical compression resistance priority to required because the buttons may be clipped otherwise. Typically a width constraint should be provided.

When using `layoutSubviews`, the frame should be set with a size at least as large as the size returned from `sizeThatFits` (in both dimensions). Measure the minimum size using `sizeThatFits`. Pass your container‚Äôs width limit and an unlimited height. An assertion will fail if the height is not unlimited. This is a reminder that handling restricted heights is not currently supported.

```swift
override func layoutSubviews() {
    super.layoutSubviews()
    
    let availableSize = CGSize(width: bounds.width, height: .greatestFiniteMagnitude)
    let requiredSize = buttonStack.sizeThatFits(availableSize)
    buttonStack.frame = CGRect(origin: .zero, size: requiredSize)
}
```

The buttons can be styled however you like. Colour, font, shadow, highlight state etc.

- Set both an image and a title.
- Don‚Äôt modify the `imageEdgeInsets` or `titleEdgeInsets` because DynamicButtonStack needs to adjust these to set the stacking and alignment inside the buttons.
- Customise any other properties however you like. Setting `contentEdgeInsets` is recommended.

## Status

‚úÖ DynamicButtonStack is considered ready for use in production.

‚ÜîÔ∏è Respects both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts.

üòá There is no private API use or interference with private subviews.

## Q & A

### Does DynamicButtonStack use modern layout API like constraints, UIStackView or SwiftUI?

üòÑ No.

### Would this be easier with SwiftUI?

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe. If you think so I‚Äôd love to see how this would look.
